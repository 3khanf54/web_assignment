##Colour Choices
My colour scheme consists of two pastel shades of the colour blue. These colours were generated using an online palette generator. According to an article I read, it is said to create feelings of calmness and peacefulness. I decided to use pastel shades of the colour blue because they are not harsh on the eyes and therefore pleasant to look at.
 
##Accessibility
One of the things that make my website accessible would be the alternative text for the images. This means that people who are blind can access the information on the website, such as using a screen reader, which would read the information on the page including the alternative texts. Besides this, the content on the website is well organised and readable. The navigation bar is not hidden and every page has clear titles to indicate the location of the website. 

##Evaluation
I think in terms of presentation, my website is good as it displays the information clearly and is pleasing to look at. As this is a portfolio website, I think there is a lot more I could have added such as contact links including social media and email. Nonetheless, I think it turned out well.

The difficulties that I came across during the process of this website would be that some of the content on the pages didn't align properly at first. For instance, due to having a different format such as bullet points. I also had difficulty making my breakpoint for mobile version work. I managed to fix some content on the pages but I couldn't completely make it responsive.

I focused on two devices; laptop and an android phone (Samsung Galaxy S6 - 414 x 732 ). I took a laptop first approach as this was easier for me to work with first. I tested my website using device mode available in Google Chrome. 

I chose to have a simple design so that the focus is on the content and to make it easier to navigate around the website.
