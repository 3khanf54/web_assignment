#Coursework Assignment 1

##Background
The purpose of my website is to serve as a portfolio website for my sister. 

##Wire Frames

##Colour Choices
My colour scheme consists of two pastel shades of the colour blue. These colours were generated using an online palette generator. According to an article I read, it is said to create feelings of calmness and peacefulness. I decided to use pastel shades of the colour blue because they are not harsh on the eyes and therefore pleasant to look at.
 
##Accessibility
One of the things that make my website accessible would be the alternative text for the images. This means that people who are blind can access the information on the website, such as using a screen reader, which would read the information on the page including the alternative texts. Besides this, the content on the website is well organised and readable. The navigation bar is not hidden and every page has clear titles to indicate the location of the website. 

##Evaluation
To what extent did you tackle the problem that you set out to solve?
I think in terms of presentation, my website is good as it displays the information clearly and is pleasing to look at. As this is a portfolio website, I think there is a lot more I could have added such as contact links including social media and email. Nonetheless, I think it turned out well.

In terms of difficulties I came across during the process of this website, some of the content on the pages didn't align properly at first. For instance, due to having a different format such as bullet points. Aside from this, I didn't encounter any major problems.   

How did you test your website/web-application on multiple devices, and what did you find out?

I chose to have a simple design so that the focus is on the content and to make it easier to navigate around the website. I took a desktop first approach as this was easier for me to work with first.
