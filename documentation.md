##Background
The purpose of my website is to serve as a portfolio website for my sister. 

##Wire Frames

##Colour Choices
My colour scheme consists of two colours; Sky Blue #79D7DE and Sea Green #2FB4BD.
I decided to use these lighter shades of the colours blue and green because they are not harsh on the eyes and therefore pleasant to look at.
According to an article I read, it is said to create feelings of calmness and peacefulness. These colours were generated using Canva Colour Palette feature.
It uses an image to generate to colour scheme that matches the shades in the image.
